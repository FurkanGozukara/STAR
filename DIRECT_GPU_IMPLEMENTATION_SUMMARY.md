# Direct GPU Implementation Summary

## What Changed
We removed the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` approach and implemented direct GPU ID selection. This means:

### Before (CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES approach):
- Set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1` to use GPU 1
- PyTorch would see only GPU 1 as `cuda:0`
- All operations used `cuda:0` which mapped to the physical GPU 1
- Other GPUs were hidden from PyTorch

### After (Direct GPU ID approach):
- Directly use `cuda:1` to use GPU 1
- All GPUs remain visible to PyTorch
- Operations explicitly specify which GPU to use
- More transparent and flexible

## Code Changes

### 1. Global Variable
```python
# Before
SELECTED_GPU_DEVICE = "cuda:0"

# After  
SELECTED_GPU_ID = 0  # Stores the GPU index (0, 1, 2, etc.)
```

### 2. Get GPU Device
```python
# Before
def get_gpu_device():
    return SELECTED_GPU_DEVICE if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"

# After
def get_gpu_device():
    if torch.cuda.is_available() and torch.cuda.device_count() > 0:
        return f"cuda:{SELECTED_GPU_ID}"
    else:
        return "cpu"
```

### 3. Set GPU Device
```python
# Before
os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = gpu_num
SELECTED_GPU_DEVICE = f"cuda:0"

# After
SELECTED_GPU_ID = gpu_num
torch.cuda.set_device(gpu_num)
```

## Usage Example

```python
# Select GPU 1
set_gpu_device("GPU 1: RTX 4090")

# All operations now use cuda:1
device = get_gpu_device()  # Returns "cuda:1"
tensor = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3]).to(device)
model = model.to(device)

# The actual operations run on GPU 1
collate_fn(data, device)  # Uses cuda:1
```

## Benefits

1. **Clear Device Usage**: You see exactly which GPU is being used (`cuda:0`, `cuda:1`, etc.)
2. **No Environment Side Effects**: Doesn't affect other processes
3. **Multi-GPU Friendly**: All GPUs remain visible for potential multi-GPU operations
4. **Better Error Messages**: Can validate GPU availability and provide clear errors
5. **PyTorch Native**: Works with PyTorch's built-in device management

## Testing

Run `python test_gpu_selection.py` to verify:
- GPU detection works correctly
- Device selection updates properly
- Tensors are placed on the correct GPU
- Invalid GPU IDs are handled gracefully
