# Cancellation System Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

From the user logs, several critical problems with the cancellation system were identified:

1. **Model loading cannot be interrupted mid-process** - The user clicked cancel during CogVLM2 model loading, but it continued to 100% completion
2. **Cancellation state persistence** - Error messages from cancelled operations were propagated to new runs
3. **Confusing error handling** - System reported "cancelled" but actually completed operations
4. **Insufficient cancellation checks** - Missing checks throughout the processing pipeline

## Root Causes

1. **Hugging Face model loading is blocking** - `AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained()` cannot be interrupted once started
2. **Cancellation state not reset properly** - Reset happened in finally block, but new runs inherited error states
3. **Error text propagation** - Cancelled caption text was being used as prompts in subsequent runs
4. **Missing context in cancellation checks** - Hard to debug where cancellation was triggered

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Cancellation Manager (`logic/cancellation_manager.py`)

- **Added contextual logging**: `check_cancel(context)` now logs where cancellation was triggered
- **Added timeout-based checking**: `check_cancel_with_timeout()` for long-running operations
- **Improved reset logging**: Better visibility when cancellation state is reset

### 2. Improved Model Loading (`logic/cogvlm_utils.py`)

- **Threaded model loading**: Model loading runs in separate thread with periodic cancellation checks
- **Pre-loading cancellation checks**: Multiple checks before starting the loading process
- **Post-loading cleanup**: If cancellation detected after loading, model is cleaned up properly
- **Clear user messaging**: Logs explain that model loading cannot be interrupted once started
- **Better error handling**: Distinguishes between cancelled before/during/after loading

### 3. Better Error Text Handling (`secourses_app.py`)

- **Prompt sanitization**: Prevents error/cancellation text from being used as prompts
- **Early cancellation state reset**: Reset happens at the very start of new operations
- **Error text filtering**: Auto-caption results with error/cancellation text are not propagated to prompts

### 4. Scene Processing Improvements (`logic/upscaling_core.py`, `logic/scene_processing_core.py`)

- **Per-scene cancellation checks**: Cancellation checked before processing each scene
- **First scene caption handling**: Proper cancellation handling for first scene auto-captioning
- **Error text filtering**: Cancelled caption results don't get propagated as scene captions
- **Immediate error propagation**: CancelledError properly re-raised to stop processing

### 5. Enhanced Cancellation Checks Throughout Pipeline

- **Contextual checks**: All `check_cancel()` calls now include context strings
- **Strategic placement**: Checks before major operations (model loading, scene processing, etc.)
- **Proper exception handling**: CancelledError properly caught and re-raised where needed

## Key Technical Improvements

### Model Loading Cancellation Strategy
```python
# Use separate thread for model loading with periodic checks
def load_model_thread():
    # Final check before loading
    if cancellation_manager.is_cancelled():
        model_loading_result["cancelled_before_start"] = True
        return
    
    # Load model (cannot be interrupted)
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(...)

# Wait with periodic cancellation checks
while not model_loading_complete.is_set():
    if model_loading_complete.wait(timeout=0.5):
        break
    # User can cancel during loading, we handle it after completion
```

### Error Text Prevention
```python
# Prevent error text from becoming prompts
if "cancelled" in current_user_prompt_val.lower() or "error" in current_user_prompt_val.lower():
    logger.info("Skipping auto-caption because prompt contains error/cancelled text from previous run")
    current_user_prompt_val = "..."  # Reset to default
```

### Contextual Cancellation Logging
```python
# Enhanced logging for better debugging
cancellation_manager.check_cancel("before model loading")
cancellation_manager.check_cancel("after scene processing")
cancellation_manager.check_cancel(f"before processing scene {scene_idx + 1}")
```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **During Model Loading**: User sees clear message that loading cannot be interrupted, but cancellation is detected immediately after completion and model is cleaned up
2. **Between Operations**: Cancellation stops processing immediately at the next checkpoint
3. **New Runs**: Clean state with no error text inherited from previous cancelled runs
4. **Error Messages**: Clear, contextual information about where cancellation occurred
5. **UI State**: Proper button state management and status messages

## User Experience Improvements

- **Responsive Cancellation**: Cancellation detected within 0.5 seconds during most operations
- **Clear Messaging**: Users understand when operations can/cannot be interrupted
- **Clean State**: New runs start fresh without inherited error states
- **Better Debugging**: Contextual logging helps identify cancellation points
- **Proper Cleanup**: Resources properly cleaned up when operations are cancelled

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test cancellation during model loading** - Should show warning and cleanup after loading completes
2. **Test cancellation between scenes** - Should stop immediately before next scene
3. **Test rapid cancellation/restart** - New runs should start clean
4. **Test error text propagation** - Error messages should not become prompts
5. **Test UI state** - Cancel button should show/hide correctly

## Limitations Acknowledged

- **Model loading cannot be interrupted mid-process** - This is a Hugging Face limitation
- **Some operations have minimum completion time** - FFmpeg operations complete current frame processing
- **Resource cleanup may take a moment** - CUDA cache clearing and model cleanup takes time

These fixes significantly improve the cancellation system's reliability and user experience while working within the technical constraints of the underlying libraries.
