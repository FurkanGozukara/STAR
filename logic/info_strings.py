TARGET_RESOLUTION_MODE_INFO = """How to apply the target H/W limits.
'Ratio Upscale': Upscales by the largest factor possible without exceeding Target H/W, preserving aspect ratio. Ratio upscale doesn't work for Image Based Upscaler and yields very poor results for STAR model.
'Downscale then 4x': For STAR models, downscales towards Target H/W √∑ 4, then applies 4x upscale. For image upscalers, adapts to model scale (e.g., 2x model = Target H/W √∑ 2). Can clean noisy high-res input before upscaling."""

AUTO_ASPECT_RESOLUTION_INFO = """Automatically calculate optimal resolution that maintains input video aspect ratio within the pixel budget (Target H √ó Target W).
- Triggered whenever you change video or process batch videos
- Maintains exact aspect ratio while maximizing quality within pixel limits
- Prevents manual resolution adjustment for different aspect ratios
- Example: 1024√ó1024 budget + 360√ó640 input ‚Üí auto-sets to 720√ó1280 (maintains 9:16 ratio, uses 921,600 pixels)"""

CAPTION_UNLOAD_STRATEGY_INFO = """Memory management after captioning.
'full': Unload model completely from VRAM/RAM (frees most memory).
'cpu': Move model to RAM (faster next time, uses RAM, not for quantized models)."""

'before': Apply before upscaling (may be enhanced further)
'after': Apply after upscaling (final enhancement)"""

'Light Degradation': Better for relatively clean inputs (e.g., downloaded web videos).
'Heavy Degradation': Better for inputs with significant compression artifacts, noise, or blur."""

SOLVER_MODE_INFO = """Diffusion solver type.

'normal': More steps (default ~50), slower, potentially slightly better detail/coherence."""

COLOR_CORRECTION_INFO = """Attempts to match the color tone of the output to the input video. Helps prevent color shifts.
'AdaIN' / 'Wavelet': Different algorithms for color matching. AdaIN is often a good default.
'None': Disables color correction."""

MAX_CHUNK_LEN_INFO = """IMPORTANT for VRAM. This is the standard way the application manages VRAM. It divides the entire sequence of video frames into sequential, non-overlapping chunks.
- Mechanism: The STAR model processes one complete chunk (of this many frames) at a time.
- 32 Frames is best quality and uses a lot of VRAM. So reduce frame count if you get Out of Memory Error"""

CONTEXT_OVERLAP_INFO = """Process extra frames for last chunks to ensure optimal quality. When the last chunk is not equal to the user-set chunk size, this processes additional frames but only keeps the necessary output.
- Example: For 70 frames with 32-frame chunks, instead of processing only 6 frames for the last chunk (poor quality), it processes 32 frames (38-69) but keeps only the last 6 (64-69).
- Quality Impact: Ensures all chunks have optimal processing conditions by always processing the full user-set chunk size."""

**üí° Optimization Tips:**
- **Batch Size**: Start with 2-4, increase if you have more VRAM
- **2x Models**: Significantly faster and uses lesser VRAM
- **4x Models**: Better for very low resolution videos to upscale like 960p to 3840p
- **Popular Models**: 
  - 2xLiveActionV1_SPAN_490000: Excellent for live-action video
  - RealESRGAN_x4plus: Good general-purpose 4x upscaler
  - DAT-2 series: High quality but slower

**Time Range Examples:**

- `1.5-3.2` ‚Üí Cut from 1.5 to 3.2 seconds  
- `1:30-2:45` ‚Üí Cut from 1 minute 30 seconds to 2 minutes 45 seconds
- `0:05-0:10,0:20-0:30` ‚Üí Multiple segments

**Frame Range Examples:**

- `30-90,150-210` ‚Üí Cut frames 30-90 and 150-210
- `0-120,240-360` ‚Üí Multiple frame segments

**Tips:**
- Use time ranges for easier input (supports MM:SS format)
- Use frame ranges for frame-perfect editing
- Preview first segment to verify before processing
- All cuts use your current FFmpeg settings from Output & Comparison tab
- Cut videos are saved in organized folders with metadata
"""

FACE_RESTORATION_HELP = """
**Face Restoration Tips:**
- **Fidelity Weight 0.3-0.5**: Focus on quality enhancement, may change face slightly
- **Fidelity Weight 0.7-0.8**: Balance between quality and identity preservation  
- **Fidelity Weight 0.8-1.0**: Maximum identity preservation, minimal changes

**Best Practices:**
- Use comparison video to evaluate results before final processing
- Start with fidelity weight 0.7 for most videos
- Enable colorization only for grayscale/black & white content
- Higher batch sizes speed up processing but use more VRAM
- Face restoration works best on videos with clear, visible faces

**Model Requirements:**
- CodeFormer models should be placed in `pretrained_weight/` directory
- The system will automatically detect available models
- 'Auto' mode uses the default CodeFormer model with optimal settings
