'Ratio Upscale': Upscales by the largest factor possible without exceeding Target H/W, preserving aspect ratio. Ratio upscale doesn't work for Image Based Upscaler and yields very poor results for STAR model.
'Downscale then 4x': For STAR models, downscales towards Target H/W √∑ 4, then applies 4x upscale. For image upscalers, adapts to model scale (e.g., 2x model = Target H/W √∑ 2). Can clean noisy high-res input before upscaling."""

**üí° Optimization Tips:**
- **Batch Size**: Start with 2-4, increase if you have more VRAM

- **Popular Models**:

- `1:30-2:45` ‚Üí Cut from 1 minute 30 seconds to 2 minutes 45 seconds

FACE_RESTORATION_HELP = """
**Face Restoration Tips:**
- **Fidelity Weight 0.3-0.5**: Focus on quality enhancement, may change face slightly
- **Fidelity Weight 0.7-0.8**: Balance between quality and identity preservation  
- **Fidelity Weight 0.8-1.0**: Maximum identity preservation, minimal changes

**Best Practices:**
- Use comparison video to evaluate results before final processing
- Start with fidelity weight 0.7 for most videos
- Enable colorization only for grayscale/black & white content
- Higher batch sizes speed up processing but use more VRAM
- Face restoration works best on videos with clear, visible faces

**Model Requirements:**
- CodeFormer models should be placed in `pretrained_weight/` directory
- The system will automatically detect available models
- 'Auto' mode uses the default CodeFormer model with optimal settings
