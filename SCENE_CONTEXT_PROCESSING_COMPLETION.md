# SCENE-LEVEL CONTEXT PROCESSING IMPLEMENTATION - COMPLETED ✅

## **IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY**

### **✅ Context Window Processing for Scenes Implemented**
- **Full context processing logic** implemented in `logic/scene_processing_core.py`
- **Uses the same context_processor module** as the main upscaling core
- **Proper chunk calculation** with context overlap for scene processing
- **Supports all context parameters**: `max_chunk_len`, `context_overlap`, `enable_chunk_optimization`

### **✅ Key Features Implemented**

1. **Context-Based Chunk Calculation**
   - Uses `calculate_context_chunks()` from `logic/context_processor.py`
   - Validates chunk plans with `validate_chunk_plan()`
   - Logs detailed chunk processing summaries

2. **Proper Frame Management**
   - Processes frames with context from previous chunks
   - Extracts only new output frames (excluding context frames)
   - Maintains correct frame naming and ordering

3. **Memory Management**
   - Proper GPU memory cleanup after each chunk
   - Efficient frame processing with context overlap
   - Compatible with existing VRAM optimization settings

4. **Chunk Saving Support**
   - Saves context-processed chunks with proper naming
   - RIFE interpolation support for scene context chunks
   - Immediate frame saving for progressive processing

### **✅ Integration with Existing Systems**
- **Scene splitting**: Works seamlessly with automatic and manual scene detection
- **Batch processing**: Full compatibility with batch video processing
- **RIFE interpolation**: Applies to scene context chunks when enabled
- **Metadata**: Proper metadata generation for scene context processing

### **✅ Processing Flow**
```
Scene Context Window Processing:
1. Calculate context chunks for scene frames
2. For each chunk:
   - Process frames including context overlap
   - Extract only new output frames
   - Save frames with correct names
   - Save chunk video if enabled
   - Apply RIFE if enabled
3. Continue to next chunk with proper context overlap
```

### **✅ Fallback Behavior**
- **Chunked processing**: Clean fallback to standard chunked processing
- **Error handling**: Proper validation and error messages
- **Backwards compatibility**: Works with all existing scene processing options

## **TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Recommended Test Cases**
1. **Scene + Context Window**: Enable both scene splitting and context window
2. **Various Context Overlaps**: Test with different `context_overlap` values (4, 8, 16)
3. **Small Scenes**: Test scenes with fewer frames than `max_chunk_len`
4. **Large Scenes**: Test scenes requiring multiple context chunks
5. **With RIFE**: Test scene context processing + RIFE interpolation
6. **Batch Scenes**: Test batch processing with scene context enabled

### **Expected Behavior**
- **No warnings**: Should see "Processing with context window" instead of fallback warnings
- **Chunk logging**: Detailed context chunk processing logs
- **Proper output**: Scene videos with improved temporal consistency
- **Performance**: Similar to non-scene context processing

## **COMPLETION STATUS: 100% ✅**

Scene-level context processing is now **fully implemented** and ready for testing. The implementation provides:
- ✅ Full feature parity with main upscaling core context processing
- ✅ Proper integration with scene splitting workflows  
- ✅ RIFE interpolation support for scene context chunks
- ✅ Clean fallback to chunked processing when context is disabled
- ✅ Comprehensive logging and error handling

**Next steps**: Test with real video files to verify temporal consistency improvements in scene-based processing.
